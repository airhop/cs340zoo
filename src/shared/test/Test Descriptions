        did not test anything extra

ProxyTest
    - Was used in Phase 1 to verify that our client was able to reach the server.
    - The MockHandler was created in order to pass back 200s in order to save ourselves from having to create
        new games and to show that the client did reach the server.

serverTest
    - used to verify that we had command objects and that they did do their job.
